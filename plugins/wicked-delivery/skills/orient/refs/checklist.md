## Milestone Celebrations

Track your progress and celebrate achievements:

### Week 1 Complete
🎉 Environment set up, first contribution merged

### Month 1 Complete
🎉 Feature delivered, active team contributor

### Month 3 Complete
🎉 Domain expert in specific area, mentoring others

## Personalization

Adapt this checklist based on:
- **Project complexity**: More time for complex systems
- **Your background**: Skip familiar areas, focus on gaps
- **Team expectations**: Align with team velocity
- **Project needs**: Prioritize high-impact areas

## Usage

Track progress:
```bash
# Mark milestone complete (stores in wicked-mem if available)
# Next session will recall progress
```

## Notes Section

Use this space to capture:
- Questions that arose
- Helpful resources discovered
- Patterns learned
- Gotchas encountered
- Tips for next newcomer
