## ROI Analysis

### Financial Metrics

**Return on Investment (ROI)**:
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%
```

```
NPV = -Initial Investment + Σ(Annual Net Benefit / (1 + Discount Rate)^year)
```

- Support and documentation
- Technical debt service

**Opportunity Costs**:
- Alternative projects forgone
- Strategic initiatives delayed
- Resource allocation tradeoffs

### Benefit Categories

**Revenue Impact**:
- New revenue streams
- Revenue protection (churn reduction)

## TAM/SAM/SOM Framework

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Maximum revenue if 100% market share
- All potential customers globally
- Top-down: Industry size × relevant percentage
- Bottom-up: All potential customers × ARPU

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
- Portion we can realistically serve
- Geographic/capability constraints
- Our business model limitations
- TAM × percentage we can serve

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- What we can capture in 1-3 years
- Given competition and resources
- Realistic market share
- Near-term revenue target

### Calculation Methods

**Top-Down**:
1. Start with total market size
2. Apply filters (geography, segment, etc.)
3. Calculate addressable portion

**Bottom-Up**:
1. Count target customers
2. Estimate conversion rate
3. Calculate average revenue per customer
4. Multiply: Customers × Conversion × ARPU
