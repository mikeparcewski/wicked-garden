# v9-PR-1 — Surface Audit (kill/keep verdict)

EPIC: #601
Generated: 2026-04-23
Total surfaces audited: **142 commands + 83 skills + 10 hook scripts = 235 surfaces**

> **Method**: For each surface, applied the v9 unique-value criterion from #601:
> "Does this provide value Claude can't get from native tools (Bash, Grep, Read,
> Edit, Task, Agent) OR from another well-positioned skill (figma, plugin-dev,
> claude-md-management, wicked-testing, wicked-brain, wicked-bus, etc.)?"
>
> Then audited discovery-shape: trigger language, anti-trigger language,
> no-wrapper test, single-purpose verb-first scoping.

## Commands (by domain)

### root (8)

| Command | Verdict | Rationale | Native equivalent / merge target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aliases` | CUT | Pure backward-compat doc; v9 is the breaking-change moment. Lift content into release notes. | release notes |
| `deliberate` | KEEP-SHARPEN | Real unique value (challenge assumptions before action) but description is verbose. Sharpen to "use when about to commit to non-obvious work". | description rewrite |
| `help` | KEEP-AS-IS | Plugin-level orientation; tiny, harmless. | — |
| `report-issue` | KEEP-AS-IS | Structured GH-issue capture w/ duplicate detection — beyond what `gh issue create` does. | — |
| `reset` | KEEP-AS-IS | Domain-aware state purge with `--keep`/`--only` — not feasible inline. | — |
| `setup` | KEEP-AS-IS | Onboarding entry point; infra plumbing. | — |
| `where-am-i` | KEEP-AS-IS | Tiny path manifest for subagents (issue #576). Cheap, load-bearing. | — |

### crew (22) — sacred per epic; high KEEP density

| Command | Verdict | Rationale | Native equivalent / merge target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `crew:approve` | KEEP-AS-IS | Phase advancement w/ gate verification. Pillar #3 (dynamic SDLC). | — |
| `crew:archive` | KEEP-SHARPEN | Useful state mgmt; description is bare. Add trigger lang. | description rewrite |
| `crew:auto-approve` | KEEP-AS-IS | Yolo guardrail — non-trivial JSON state mutation w/ justification log. | — |
| `crew:convergence` | KEEP-AS-IS | Designed→Built→Wired→Tested→Integrated→Verified lifecycle — unique. | — |
| `crew:cutover` | KEEP-SHARPEN | One-shot mode-3 migration helper. Description is internal jargon. | description rewrite (or CUT post-mode-3 stable) |

| `crew:incident` | KEEP-SHARPEN | Logs production incident *to crew project*; clarifies vs platform:incident. Sharpen anti-trigger. | description rewrite |
| `crew:just-finish` | KEEP-AS-IS | Maximum-autonomy loop with guardrails — pillar #3. | — |
| `crew:migrate-gates` | CUT | Pure migration guide for v6.0-beta.3 → v6.0; v6 shipped a year ago. | adopt-legacy skill |
| `crew:operate` | KEEP-AS-IS | Operate phase entry — distinct from `status`. | — |
| `crew:profile` | KEEP-SHARPEN | Sets autonomy/style/plan-mode prefs — useful but description is bare. | description rewrite |

| `crew:yolo` | CUT | Pure alias for `crew:auto-approve`. v9 is the breaking-change moment to drop the alias. | crew:auto-approve |

### search (18) — mostly CUT after wicked-brain ownership

The brain adapter took over the unified index; most search commands are now thin wrappers over `wicked-brain:search` / `wicked-brain:lsp`. Only the **graph-shape** queries (lineage, blast-radius, hotspots) remain unique value.

| Command | Verdict | Rationale | Native equivalent / merge target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search:blast-radius` | KEEP-AS-IS | Dependents-graph traversal — unique to wicked-garden index. | — |
| `search:categories` | KEEP-SHARPEN | Symbol-category breakdown is unique; description is dry. | description rewrite |

| `search:index` | KEEP-AS-IS | Index-build orchestration; pillar #4 plumbing. | — |
| `search:lineage` | KEEP-AS-IS | Data-flow tracing UI→DB — exemplar unique value. | — |
| `search:quality` | KEEP-SHARPEN | Index Quality Crew — runs an internal multi-agent crew. Sharpen trigger. | description rewrite |
| `search:refs` | CUT | Duplicates `wicked-brain:lsp` + `wicked-brain:search`. | wicked-brain:lsp |
| `search:scout` | CUT | "Quick pattern recon w/o index" — that is literally Grep. | Grep |
| `search:search` | CUT | Wraps brain unified search. | wicked-brain:search |
| `search:service-map` | KEEP-AS-IS | Infra-config + code-pattern fusion to service graph — unique. | — |
| `search:sources` | KEEP-AS-IS | External MCP-source registration; brain plumbing. | — |
| `search:stats` | CUT | `wicked-brain:status` already shows index stats. | wicked-brain-status |
| `search:validate` | KEEP-SHARPEN | Index consistency checks. Useful but bury behind `search:quality`. | merge into `quality` |

### smaht (10) — mostly CUT (v6 made smaht infrastructure, not commands)

The push-orchestrator died in #428. What remains is mostly debug + import. The brain pull-model means these are largely obsolete entry points.

| Command | Verdict | Rationale | Native equivalent / merge target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smaht:briefing` | KEEP-SHARPEN | "What happened since last time" is a real ask. Sharpen trigger. | description rewrite |
| `smaht:collaborate` | MERGE | Multi-AI CLI orchestration — overlaps with `jam:council`. | merge into `jam:council` |
| `smaht:context` | CUT | Build structured context — that's what brain pull directives + Skill(smaht) already do. | brain pull directive |
| `smaht:debug` | KEEP-SHARPEN | Session-state inspection — useful. Sharpen trigger lang. | description rewrite |
| `smaht:events-import` | KEEP-AS-IS | One-shot historical migration — niche but unique. | — |
| `smaht:events-query` | KEEP-AS-IS | Cross-domain event log — pillar #4. | — |
| `smaht:help` | CUT | Per-domain help overhead. | root help |
| `smaht:learn` | CUT | Superseded by cluster-A P0 decision (2026-04-25): duplicates wicked-brain:ingest workflow. | wicked-brain:ingest |
| `smaht:libs` | CUT | Superseded by cluster-A P0 decision (2026-04-25): orphaned by v8 daemon-first architecture. | — |
| `smaht:onboard` | MERGE | Codebase onboarding — overlaps with `wicked-brain:agent (onboard)`. | merge into wicked-brain:agent |
| `smaht:smaht` | CUT | Self-named "thin shim over brain+search" — admit it's redundant. | wicked-brain:query |

### mem (8) — mostly thin wrappers over wicked-brain

| Command | Verdict | Rationale | Native equivalent / merge target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mem:consolidate` | CUT | Calls wicked-brain consolidate agent — invoke skill directly. | wicked-brain:agent (consolidate) |
| `mem:forget` | CUT | Wraps `wicked-brain:forget`. | wicked-brain-forget |
| `mem:help` | CUT | Per-domain help overhead. | root help |

| `mem:stats` | CUT | Wraps brain stats. | wicked-brain-status |
| `mem:store` | CUT | "Thin wrapper over wicked-brain-memory" — admitted in body. | wicked-brain-memory |

> **Note**: The `mem` domain in v9 collapses into a single skill (`wicked-garden:mem`) that delegates to brain. All 8 mem:* commands cut. The skill itself stays as a discovery handle (mem ≠ wicked-brain in user mental model).

### search (1) + smaht (2)

| Skill | Verdict | Rationale | Native equivalent / merge target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search/codebase-narrator` | KEEP-AS-IS | Onboarding-style code narration — distinct from raw search. | — |
| `smaht/SKILL.md` (context-assembly) | KEEP-AS-IS | Pull-model context assembly — pillar #4 entry. | — |
| `smaht/discovery` | KEEP-AS-IS | Internal `user-invocable: false` — drives Stop-hook discovery. | — |

## Hooks

Apply the grain-riding criterion: **hook fires on signal Claude can't see → KEEP. Hook fires on signal Claude can already see → CUT.**

| Hook | Verdict | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `bootstrap.py` (SessionStart) | KEEP-AS-IS | Setup gate, briefing, plugin probes — only this hook can run on session start. |
| `pre_tool.py` (PreToolUse) | KEEP-AS-IS | Validates TaskCreate/TaskUpdate metadata envelope, blocks MEMORY.md writes, gate preflight. Claude cannot self-validate envelope. |
| `post_tool.py` (PostToolUse) | KEEP-SHARPEN | Does too much: stale-marker, QE tracking, agentic detect, traces, discovery hints. Split discovery hints (cuttable) from validation (KEEP). |
| `prompt_submit.py` (UserPromptSubmit) | KEEP-AS-IS | Setup gate, facilitator re-eval directive, pull-model directive injection. Pre-prompt only the hook can do. |
| `notification.py` (Notification) | KEEP-AS-IS | Reads context-limit warnings Claude doesn't surface — adjusts smaht behavior. |
| `permission_request.py` (PermissionRequest) | KEEP-AS-IS | Auto-approves known-safe ops — reduces friction Claude cannot avoid alone. |
| `pre_compact.py` (PreCompact) | KEEP-AS-IS | Saves WIP memory before compression — Claude cannot self-snapshot pre-compaction. |
| `stop.py` (Stop) | KEEP-SHARPEN | Heavy: outcome check, memory promotion, brain compile/lint, decay, retention. Split into focused async tasks. |
| `subagent_lifecycle.py` (SubagentStart/Stop) | CUT | Logs duration + counts — observability nice-to-have but Claude doesn't need it. Telemetry can move to `wicked-bus:emit` if needed. |
| `task_completed.py` (TaskCompleted) | CUT | Emits "evaluate for storable learnings" directive — overlaps with brain consolidate + Stop hook. Claude already sees its own completions. |

> Note: `invoke.py` is the dispatcher (not a hook script in itself); it stays.

## Cross-cutting findings

### 1. Per-domain `:help` commands are pure noise (10 surfaces)

`crew:help`, `search:help`, `smaht:help`, `mem:help`, `jam:help`, `engineering:help`, `platform:help`, `product:help`, `data:help`, `delivery:help`, `agentic:help` — all of them. The root `/wicked-garden:help` covers it. **All 10 should CUT.**

### 2. mem domain is now a wrapper façade (8 surfaces)

Every `mem:*` command admits to being "thin wrapper over wicked-brain-*". v9 should cut all 8 commands and keep only the `mem` skill as a discovery handle (since "mem" ≠ "wicked-brain" in the user's mental phrasing).

### 3. search domain duplicates wicked-brain except for graph queries (8 of 18 cuttable)

`search:code`, `search:docs`, `search:search`, `search:refs`, `search:impl`, `search:scout`, `search:stats`, `search:help` all duplicate `wicked-brain:search`/`wicked-brain:lsp`. The unique value is the **graph traversal** (lineage, blast-radius, hotspots, service-map, categories, coverage). Keep those, cut the rest.

### 4. Platform observability commands are over-fragmented (4 → 1)

`platform:logs` + `platform:plugin-debug` + `platform:plugin-health` + `platform:plugin-traces` are all "tell me what wicked-garden is doing right now." Collapse into a single `platform:plugin:diagnose` with subcommands.

### 5. Engineering doc commands (3 → 1)

`engineering/docs-audit` + `engineering/generate` + `engineering/sync` all live in the doc lifecycle. Collapse into one `engineering/docs` skill that handles audit + generate + sync.

### 6. Product visual/UX surface is over-split (4 → 2)

`product/design-review` + `product/visual-review` + `product/ux-flow` + `product/ux-review` cover overlapping ground. Keep `visual-review` (visual checklist) + `ux-review` (flows/research). Drop the others.

### 7. Aliases are pure debt (3 surfaces)

`crew:yolo` (→ `auto-approve`), `data:analysis` (→ `analyze`), top-level `aliases` doc. v9 is the breaking-change moment to drop them.

### 8. The `wicked-garden:ground` skill is missing (PR-4 should add)

Per the epic, the keystone skill `wicked-garden:ground` does not exist yet. This is the **single most important add** for v9 — it's the skill that makes brain+bus discoverable at the moment of uncertainty. PR-4 must author it.

### 9. jam ↔ multi-model ↔ smaht:collaborate are three names for one capability

`jam:council` + `multi-model` skill + `smaht:collaborate` all orchestrate external LLM CLIs. Recommend: keep `jam:council` as the user-facing handle, keep `multi-model` skill as the internal capability, **cut `smaht:collaborate`**.

### 10. Hooks are mostly grain-riders; only 2 cuttable

Most hooks fire on signals Claude can't see (session start, pre-tool, pre-compaction, notifications, permission requests). Only `subagent_lifecycle` and `task_completed` fire on signals Claude already sees. Those two are the cut targets.

### 11. Surfaces that look like infrastructure rather than guidance

- `propose-process` skill → it IS the engine, not a guidance handle. Pillar #3.
- `runtime-exec` skill → marked `user-invocable: false`. Internal shim. Stays.
- `smaht/discovery` skill → marked `user-invocable: false`. Stays.
- `platform/gate-benchmark-rebaseline` → operational procedure, not user-facing. Stays for compliance.

These are correct as infrastructure; v9 must protect their role and not "discover-shape" them.

### 12. UNCERTAIN items — need human judgment

| Surface | Question |
|---|---|
| `adopt-legacy` skill | Are there any v6.0-beta.3 projects still in flight? If no → CUT. |
| `product/mockup` skill+command | Does `figma:figma-generate-design` cover ASCII wireframes + HTML/CSS previews? If yes → CUT both. |
| `crew:cutover` | After mode-3 has been default for one release → CUT. Now? KEEP one more cycle. |
| `crew:migrate-gates` | Treated as CUT above (v6 shipped a year ago). Confirm no in-flight v6.0-beta.3 projects. |
| `agentic:ask` | Is there value in routing arbitrary agentic Q&A to a command vs letting Claude answer + skills? If skills cover, CUT. |
| `engineering:arch` vs `engineering/architecture` skill vs `engineering/system-design` | Three surfaces for adjacent territory. Pick the strongest discovery shape (likely the skill `architecture` + cut the command). |

## Recommended PR-2 cut order

Sequence by blast-radius (lowest first). Each batch can be its own commit inside PR-2.

### Batch 1 — Standalone wrappers with zero dependents (safest, ~25 surfaces)

- All 10 per-domain `:help` commands
- `crew:yolo` (alias)
- `data:analysis` (alias)
- `aliases.md` root command
- All 8 `mem:*` commands
- `smaht:smaht`, `smaht:context`, `smaht:help`
- `agentic:ask`

### Batch 2 — Search-domain commands superseded by wicked-brain (8 surfaces)

- `search:code`, `search:docs`, `search:search`, `search:refs`, `search:impl`, `search:scout`, `search:stats`, `search:help`
- Skill: `unified-search`

### Batch 3 — Old migration helpers (3 surfaces)

- `crew:migrate-gates` (after confirming no in-flight beta projects)
- `adopt-legacy` skill (after confirming same)
- `crew:cutover` (after one release with mode-3 default)

### Batch 4 — Hooks (2 surfaces, integration-coupled — last)

- `subagent_lifecycle.py` (relocate telemetry to `wicked-bus:emit`)
- `task_completed.py` (Stop hook + brain consolidate already cover)

### Batch 5 — Merges (handled in PR-3 alongside description sharpening)

- Engineering docs (3 → 1)
- Platform plugin diagnostics (4 → 1)
- Product visual/UX (4 → 2)
- Search impact → blast-radius
- jam:thinking → transcript --raw

## Top 5 most duplicative surfaces (clearest CUTs)

1. **`mem:store`** + **`mem:recall`** — admit in their own bodies that they are "thin wrappers" over `wicked-brain-memory`.
2. **`search:scout`** — "quick pattern reconnaissance without index" is literally `Grep`.
3. **`unified-search` skill** — its description says "use this over Grep" but `wicked-brain:search` is the actual unified search now.
4. **`smaht:smaht`** — body admits "this command is now a thin shim over brain + search."
5. **`crew:yolo`** — pure alias for `crew:auto-approve` (one-liner that calls it).

## Top 5 KEEP-AS-IS exemplars of unique value

1. **`crew:start`** + the `propose-process` skill — pillars #1 and #3. The 9-factor facilitator rubric + dynamic phase plan is uncopyable.
2. **`jam:council`** — pillar #2. Multi-model orchestration via subprocess to external LLM CLIs (codex, gemini, etc.). Outside Claude's tool palette.
3. **`search:lineage`** — data-flow tracing UI→DB. The graph + multi-source fusion is genuinely unique.
4. **`crew:convergence`** — Designed→Built→Wired→Tested→Integrated→Verified lifecycle. Catches the "task complete but artifact not wired" failure mode native tooling misses.
5. **`deliberate`** skill — exemplar discovery-shape. "Use when about to commit to non-obvious work" maps directly to Claude's internal phrasing.

## Surprises

1. **The `mem` domain is fully wrapper** — every command says "delegates to wicked-brain". v9 lets us amputate cleanly.
2. **The search domain is mostly cuttable** (10 of 18 commands). The brain adapter swallowed the unified index. Only the graph-shape queries remain unique.
3. **`subagent_lifecycle` hook is observability theater** — it logs durations + counts but Claude doesn't act on it. Pure cuttable.
4. **`smaht:smaht` is self-aware redundancy** — its own description says "thin shim." Honest, and cuttable.
5. **Hidden uniqueness in `crew/test-task-factory` and `crew/change-type-detector`** — they look like internal helpers but they're the load-bearing classifier that routes test tasks. KEEP-AS-IS even though they don't read like discovery surfaces.
6. **`platform/gate-benchmark-rebaseline` is genuinely unique infrastructure** — niche but the kind of operational rigor wicked-garden uniquely owns.
7. **No `wicked-garden:ground` exists yet** — the keystone skill from the epic is missing. v9-PR-4 must build it.
